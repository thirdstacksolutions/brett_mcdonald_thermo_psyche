            <h3>Thermodynamic Psychology</h3>
            <p>
              If humans behave based on logic, values, and a desire for good things, then why do we sometimes act so
              destructively? Why do we feel good about ourselves one day, and bad about ourselves the next? Why are we so
              driven toward self-sacrifice and service to others? To solve these mysteries and more, we must understand
              that the mind is a machine, operating under the laws of physics.

            <h3>Unlocking the Mind</h3>
            <p>
              What if we could understand the mind with the same clarity and precision we use to study physics? Unlocking
              the Mind explores how thoughts, emotions, and behaviors can be mapped and managed like physical
              phenomena—offering a path to well-being grounded in science.
