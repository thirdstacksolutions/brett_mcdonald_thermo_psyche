          I went to college for TEN YEARS to understand the mind (no, I’m not a
          brain surgeon, I’m just a slow learner). But no matter how long I
          waited for someone to give me the keys to psychology, I was never
          really taught how the mind actually functions or what its purpose is.
          Then I realized, it’s probably because we don’t really know! So I made
          my own system by taking the laws of physics and applying them to the
          mind, and boiled it all down to a four-stroke engine.

          That might feel pretty alienating and cold, like I’m trying to strip
          away your sense of individuality and control. But our need to be
          unique and in control is exactly what got us so confused in the first
          place, because if everything is unique, nothing can be nailed down
          into a system. What’s wrong with not nailing it down? Well, we are
          rapidly approaching the Anthropocene, and the very fate of the planet
          hinges on what humans will do next with our minds. Unless we get a
          handle on our heads, we’re going to find ourselves stacked up in
          wheelbarrows by some guy shouting “Bring out your dead!” and I don’t
          like wheelbarrows or corpses, or being a corpse in a wheelbarrow.

          Mental combustion, just like physical and mechanical combustion, is a
          four-stroke process of intake, compression, power, and exhaust. This
          cycle involves fuel, an oxidizer, oil, a fuel pump, and a spark. In
          combination, these elements enable us to generate work to turn the
          axle or output shaft of this engine, and fulfill our needs. The
          various components of our mind’s fuel-to-work mechanism is explained
          below.

            The mind runs on psychological fuel made by the environmental events
            we participate in. Those can be either self-generated by our own
            behaviors, or created by forces outside of ourselves. The mind also
            uses calories from the brain to fuel itself.

        Although I describe the steps as sequential, it’s important to remember
        that the first 8 steps really happen all at once. We feel our needs,
        adhere to a schedule, interact with the environment, behave, perceive
        and process information, feel motivation to act, and perform work on our
        needs in one burst. In four stroke engines, all four phases of
        combustion happen in milliseconds, and the same is true for the mind.
        The only phase that really takes very long is the exhaust phase.

          <h3>Thermodynamic Psychology</h3>
          <p>
            If humans behave based on logic, values, and a desire for good
            things, then why do we sometimes act so destructively? Why do we
            feel good about ourselves one day, and bad about ourselves the next?
            Why are we so driven toward self-sacrifice and service to others? To
            solve these mysteries and more, we must understand that the mind is
            a machine, operating under the laws of physics.

          <p>
            What if we could understand the mind with the same clarity and
            precision we use to study physics? Unlocking the Mind explores how
            thoughts, emotions, and behaviors can be mapped and managed like
            physical phenomena—offering a path to well-being grounded in
            science.
