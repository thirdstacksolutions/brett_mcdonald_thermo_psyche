            The mind has one purpose. That purpose is to make you interact with
            your environment in a way that fulfills and protects your needs. The
            human need system is called THE AXIA, it includes six categories of
            need, in an open energy system.
          </p>
          <p>
            These human needs are survival, achievement, and experience, both
            internal and external.

            <p>
              All human needs break down into two categories. Internal needs are
              for yourself, and External needs are for other people. Since we
              are interdependent, other people’s needs are part of our own
              needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the success of our lives and the health of our being is
              determined by how well and how completely we get out needs met,
              and if needs are met with limited energy, then everything hinges
              on efficiency and balance.
            </p>
            <p>
              We must distribute our limited energy evenly between our various
              needs, giving enough to our survival, achievement, and
              experiential categories, and ensuring that we give enough to other
              people. Above all else, we must strive to waste as little energy
              as we can, and stretch our fuel as far as it will go, so as many
              needs are satisfied as possible.

              The degree to which a need is fulfilled or depleted is called
              axity, and it’s a really important determinant of how we feel and
              behave toward ourselves. Axity is what we typically think of as
              “self-esteem” or “self-worth” and it’s built when energy flows
              toward our needs. We have two main types, internal axity is made
              when you fulfill your own needs, and external axity is made when
              you fulfill the needs of other people. Having a lot of internal
              axity might mean you are neglecting the needs of other people, and
              having a lot of external axity might mean you are neglecting your
              own needs. Since unmet needs create pathology and relationship
              dysfunction, it’s important for us to remain balanced in how much
              energy we give either internally or externally.

              Anytime energy moves from one place to another, some gravity is
              made. This is as true for the mind as it is for every energy
              system in the universe. But unlike the gravity that holds your
              feet to the surface of the Earth, the mind makes psychological
              gravity, and it has a strong effect over how we feel and behave.

            <p>
              Gravity in the mind takes two forms, depending on the nature of
              the work it’s performing. Constructive work that fulfills our
              needs makes light gravity, and destructive work that harms our
              needs makes dark gravity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Light gravity attracts pro-self energy, which bolsters our
              self-concept, helps us feel more positive about meeting our needs,
              and drives us to fulfill and protect ourselves. Dark gravity acts
              in the opposite direction, attracting anti-self energy, which
              erodes our self-concept, makes us feel more negative about meeting
              our needs, and drives us to neglect and damage ourselves.

              So the next time you wonder why some people make healthy choices,
              while others are trapped in a cycle of self-destruction, consider
              the role that energy, work, and physics play. Far from acting on
              free will alone, the human mind follows the same course of
              gravitational attraction as the rest of the universe.

            <h3>Thermodynamic Psychology</h3>
            <p>
              If humans behave based on logic, values, and a desire for good
              things, then why do we sometimes act so destructively? Why do we
              feel good about ourselves one day, and bad about ourselves the
              next? Why are we so driven toward self-sacrifice and service to
              others? To solve these mysteries and more, we must understand that
              the mind is a machine, operating under the laws of physics.
