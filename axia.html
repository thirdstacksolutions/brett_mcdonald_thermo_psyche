                    The mind has one purpose. That purpose is to make you
                    interact with your environment in a way that fulfills and
                    protects your needs. The human need system is called THE
                    AXIA, it includes six categories of need, in an open energy
                    system. These human needs are survival, achievement, and
                    experience, both internal and external.

                    All human needs break down into the Internal and External
                    categories. Internal needs are for yourself, and External
                    needs are for other people. Since we are interdependent,
                    other people’s needs are part of our own needs, and vice
                    versa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the success of our lives and the health of our being
                    is determined by how well and how completely we get out
                    needs met, and if needs are met with limited energy, then
                    everything hinges on efficiency and balance.

                    We must distribute our limited energy evenly between our
                    various needs, giving enough to our survival, achievement,
                    and experiential categories, and ensuring that we give
                    enough to ourselves and to other people, back and forth.
                    Above all else, we must strive to waste as little energy as
                    we can, and stretch our fuel as far as it will go, so as
                    many needs are satisfied as possible.

                Balancing Internal and External Needs

                <p>
                    The degree to which a need is fulfilled or depleted is
                    called axity, and it’s a really important determinant of how
                    we feel and behave toward ourselves. Axity is what we
                    typically think of as “self-esteem” or “self-worth” and it’s
                    built when energy flows toward our needs. We have two main
                    types, internal axity is made when you fulfill your own
                    needs, and external axity is made when you fulfill the needs
                    of other people. Having a lot of internal axity might mean
                    you are neglecting the needs of other people, and having a
                    lot of external axity might mean you are neglecting your own
                    needs. Since unmet needs create pathology and relationship
                    dysfunction, it’s important for us to remain balanced in how
                    much energy we give either internally or externally.

                    <h3>Thermodynamic Psychology</h3>
                    <p>
                        If humans behave based on logic, values, and a desire
                        for good things, then why do we sometimes act so
                        destructively? Why do we feel good about ourselves one
                        day, and bad about ourselves the next? Why are we so
                        driven toward self-sacrifice and service to others? To
                        solve these mysteries and more, we must understand that
                        the mind is a machine, operating under the laws of
                        physics.

                        What if we could understand the mind with the same
                        clarity and precision we use to study physics? Unlocking
                        the Mind explores how thoughts, emotions, and behaviors
                        can be mapped and managed like physical
                        phenomena—offering a path to well-being grounded in
                        science.
