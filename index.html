            All of our needs are met with energy that flows through us, and
            since we run on energy, humans follow the laws of thermodynamics.
            Every energy system in the universe, from cars, to squirrels, to
            planetary bodies, to single fuel cells, must follow the first law of
            thermodynamics, which states that energy can neither be created nor
            destroyed, it can only change forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might not realize it, but this unassuming little law is, by
            orders of magnitude, the most powerful force in human life. It
            shapes how we think, behave, operate, and live from the time we are
            born to the time we die, and we usually don‚Äôt give it more than a
            glancing thought.

            Think of your mind like a¬†machine built for flight‚Äîlike a dragonfly
            with a four-stroke engine at its core. The wings represent the
            different areas of your life where energy must be applied: Survival,
            Achievement, and Experiential needs, both for yourself and for
            other¬†people.
          </p>
          <p>
            But wings alone don‚Äôt create lift‚Äîthe engine matters. That‚Äôs where
            the laws of thermodynamics come in: energy has to be pulled in,
            transformed, and used efficiently, or the system stalls. Your mind
            constantly distributes and directs limited energy to keep you moving
            forward, balancing all those wings in flight. Too much weight on one
            wing? You veer off course. Run out of fuel? You crash.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Mind Machine helps you recognize those imbalances, so you can
            course-correct and fly with agility.

              Mental combustion, just like physical and mechanical combustion,
              is a four-stroke process of intake, compression, power, and
              exhaust. This cycle involves fuel, an oxidizer, oil, a fuel pump,
              and a spark. In combination, these elements enable us to generate
              work to turn the axle or output shaft of this engine, and fulfill
              our needs.

                  Brett McDonald holds a doctorate degree in business
                  administration and works as an organizational leadership and
                  team developer. Before that, she spent 17 years as a mental

                  She loves the idea of loving skiing, hiking, distance running,
                  and paddleboarding, but she mostly prefers working on puzzles,
                  eating candy, and practicing Solid Gold dance routines in the
                  living room. Her favorite color is rainbow sparkle, her
                  favorite American Gladiator is Malibu, but she hates buffets
                  and audience clap-alongs.

                Is there ever really anything new under the sun? I was always
                told there wasn‚Äôt. When I was in graduate school, the teachers
                of my research classes would say, ‚ÄúThe idea you want to
                investigate, your theory, your profound and novel approach, has
                already been done before by someone probably more qualified,
                smarter‚Ä¶better looking. There‚Äôs nothing new so don‚Äôt even fool
                yourself.‚Äù I think subconsciously I took issue with that because
                it‚Äôs so boring not to create something original, and I‚Äôm not
                very good at regurgitating other people‚Äôs ideas anyway. When I
                was twenty however, I only wanted to learn all I could, get
                passing grades, and start practicing the way I was taught, in a
                Good Alice manner.

            And why would I buck the field of study I had had been in love with
            since I was six years old? I grew up fascinated and inspired by the
            everything about psychology, following it with a blind and
            infatuated trust that held fast‚Äîas long as my learning remained
            confined to the soft bosom of academia and the classroom cocoon.

                like lipstick in a kissing booth. With each passing year of my
                therapy practice, I grew more and more fed up with constantly
                trying to fit square, or rectangle, or triangle, or oblong pegs
                into round holes of my clients (that came out a little awkward,

                Although a better mousetrap was clearly needed, I knew the tried

                many for too long had extinguished the insights of ‚Äúon the map‚Äù
                thinking. Fresh intellectual territory had to be found, so I
                shoved Good Alice, her starched apron and straight-lined rules

                psychology. Once I let go of what I thought I knew, my hands

            Upon leaving the shores of standardized treatments and theories, I
            was surprised to find myself venturing into the waters of physics, a
            field far removed from the intangible material in the humanities,
            and even further removed from my comfort zone. That‚Äôs because I
            always got C‚Äôs in the STEM subjects, and never considered myself
            interested or even capable of applying those hard concepts to the
            soft canvas of the human mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I overcome those hesitations aside when I saw how the more
            objective and tangible angles of physics were more comforting,
            inspiring, and overall better fitting for clients than the
            traditional angles of psychology. That people seeking counseling
            would find more solace and footing in physics might seem
            incongruous, but it took away the self-blame and confusion that
            ‚Äúsoft‚Äù theories of mind create, and revealed the unseen currents
            pulling and pushing the mind. The experience was a lot like Dorothy
            stepping out of her little house into OZ, and the world was in color
            for the first time.

            <h3>Thermodynamic Psychology</h3>
            <p>
              If humans behave based on logic, values, and a desire for good
              things, then why do we sometimes act so destructively? Why do we
              feel good about ourselves one day, and bad about ourselves the
              next? Why are we so driven toward self-sacrifice and service to
              others? To solve these mysteries and more, we must understand that
              the mind is a machine, operating under the laws of physics.

            <h3>Unlocking the Mind</h3>
            <p>
              What if we could understand the mind with the same clarity and
              precision we use to study physics? Unlocking the Mind explores how
              thoughts, emotions, and behaviors can be mapped and managed like
              physical phenomena‚Äîoffering a path to well-being grounded in
              science.
