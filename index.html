        Here’s an embarrassing truth about humanity: the thing we use to understand everything is the thing we
        understand the least. You don’t believe me? Just look up “How does the mind work?” and see how everyone dances
        around the issue. You either get a bunch of technical information about the brain, or you get a lot of spiritual
        meditative self-helpy stuff. We probably skip over the real issue because we’d rather not admit how little we
        really understand about it.

            >Mental combustion, just like physical and mechanical combustion, is a four-stroke process of intake,
            compression, power, and exhaust. This cycle involves fuel, an oxidizer, oil, a fuel pump, and a spark. In
            combination, these elements enable us to generate work to turn the axle or output shaft of this engine, and
            fulfill our needs.</p
