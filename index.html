          Here’s an embarrassing truth about humanity: the thing we use to understand everything is the thing we
          understand the least. You don’t believe me? Just look up “How does the mind work?” and see how everyone dances
          around the issue. You either get a bunch of technical information about the brain, or you get a lot of
          spiritual meditative self-helpy stuff. We probably skip over the real issue because we’d rather not admit how
          little we really understand about it.

You just weren’t given the manual. I spent ten years studying psychology, waiting for someone to explain how the mind works. No one did—so I decided to build the model myself. It’s mechanical. It’s functional. It’s driven by need, runs on fuel, and is affected by gravity. Now? I’m writing the owner’s manual.'" />

          All of our needs are met with energy that flows through us, and since we run on energy, humans follow the laws
          of thermodynamics. Every energy system in the universe, from cars, to squirrels, to planetary bodies, to
          single fuel cells, must follow the first law of thermodynamics, which states that energy can neither be
          created nor destroyed, it can only change forms. You might not realize it, but this unassuming little law is,
          by orders of magnitude, the most powerful force in human life. It shapes how we think, behave, operate, and
          live from the time we are born to the time we die, and we usually don’t give it more than a glancing thought.

          Think of your mind like a machine built for flight—like a dragonfly with a four-stroke engine at its core. The
          wings represent the different areas of your life where energy must be applied: Survival, Achievement, and
          Experiential needs, both for yourself and for other people.
        </p>
        <p>
          But wings alone don’t create lift—the engine matters. That’s where the laws of thermodynamics come in: energy
          has to be pulled in, transformed, and used efficiently, or the system stalls. Your mind constantly distributes
          and directs limited energy to keep you moving forward, balancing all those wings in flight. Too much weight on
          one wing? You veer off course. Run out of fuel? You crash.
        </p>
        <p> The Mind Machine helps you recognize those imbalances, so you can course-correct and fly with agility. </p>

            Mental combustion, just like physical and mechanical combustion, is a four-stroke process of intake,
            compression, power, and exhaust. This cycle involves fuel, an oxidizer, oil, a fuel pump, and a spark. In
            combination, these elements enable us to generate work to turn the axle or output shaft of this engine, and
            fulfill our needs.

            The mind has one purpose, making you interact with your environment in a way that fulfills and protects your
            needs. The human need system is called THE AXIA, it includes six categories of need, in an open energy
            system.
