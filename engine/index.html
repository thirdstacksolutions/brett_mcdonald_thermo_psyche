            I went to college for TEN YEARS to understand the mind (no, I’m not
            a brain surgeon, I’m just a slow learner). But no matter how long I
            waited for someone to give me the keys to psychology, I was never
            really taught how the mind actually functions or what its purpose
            is. Then I realized, it’s probably because we don’t really know! So
            I made my own system by taking the laws of physics and applying them
            to the mind, and boiled it all down to a four-stroke engine.

            That might feel pretty alienating and cold, like I’m trying to strip
            away your sense of individuality and control. But our need to be
            unique and in control is exactly what got us so confused in the
            first place, because if everything is unique, nothing can be nailed
            down into a system. What’s wrong with not nailing it down? Well, we
            are rapidly approaching the Anthropocene, and the very fate of the
            planet hinges on what humans will do next with our minds. Unless we
            get a handle on our heads, we’re going to find ourselves stacked up
            in wheelbarrows by some guy shouting “Bring out your dead!” and I
            don’t like wheelbarrows or corpses, or being a corpse in a
            wheelbarrow.

              Mental combustion, just like physical and mechanical combustion,
              is a four-stroke process of intake, compression, power, and
              exhaust. This cycle involves fuel, an oxidizer, oil, a fuel pump,
              and a spark. In combination, these elements enable us to generate
              work to turn the axle or output shaft of this engine, and fulfill
              our needs. The various components of our mind’s fuel-to-work
              mechanism is explained below.

            Although I describe the steps as sequential, it’s important to
            remember that the first 8 steps really happen all at once. We feel
            our needs, adhere to a schedule, interact with the environment,
            behave, perceive and process information, feel motivation to act,
            and perform work on our needs in one burst. In four stroke engines,
            all four phases of combustion happen in milliseconds, and the same
            is true for the mind. The only phase that really takes very long is
            the exhaust phase.

              If humans behave based on logic, values, and a desire for good
              things, then why do we sometimes act so destructively? Why do we
              feel good about ourselves one day, and bad about ourselves the
              next? Why are we so driven toward self-sacrifice and service to
              others? To solve these mysteries and more, we must understand that
              the mind is a machine, operating under the laws of physics.

              What if we could understand the mind with the same clarity and

              thoughts, emotions, and behaviors can be mapped and managed like
